# DEPRECATED: `straight.el` support

This repository was meant to contain sample configurations using
`straight.el`, as well as benchmarks comparing `straight.el` and
`package.el`. However, it has not been kept up to date. I plan to
reintroduce up-to-date examples and benchmarks in the main
`straight.el` repository. See:

* <https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el/issues/74>
* <https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el/issues/183>
